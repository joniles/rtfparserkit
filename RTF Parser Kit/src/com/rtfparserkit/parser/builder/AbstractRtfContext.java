/**
 * An implementation of all methods defined by RtfContext. All methods
 * throw an IllegalStateException, unless the object is configured not to
 * throw exception at construction time. The idea is that derived classes
 * implement exactly the needed functionality and RTF events resulting in
 * calling methods which have not been overridden means something is wrong.
 * The only method which is supposed to be used by sub-classes is
 * processGroupEnd(), which pops the context from the provided RtfContextStack.
